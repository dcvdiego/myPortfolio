  MyPortfolio âœ¨ ðŸš€ - Beta
</h2>

My name is Diego Chuman. I am an aspiring full stack developer and this is my portfolio repository, why not keep it open-source :D.

Prod: https://diegochuman.com
Works best with the latest version of Chrome/Edge

Remember to install dependencies after cloning it locally.

### Run Development Environment

Enter backend and run yarn dev:
```bash
cd backend
```

```bash
yarn dev # npm run dev
```

Then cd to frontend in a new terminal tab and do the same as above.

### Test Production Environment

Don't, sorry :)

### CURRENT BUGS

- Figure out how to do something when first loop of animation ends so it goes back to being Idle for avatar animations!
- Can't interact with CustomAvatar for some reason
- In mobile, in the ExperienceApp screens, scrolling is way too sensitive, not sure why
- The helper overlays don't work in mobile either, it is cut off, styling needs to change or do overlays differently in mobile
- Firefox drei HTML does not work (works in Firefox Nightly with a few bugs such as scrolling)

### NEXT STEPS IN DEVELOPMENT
- Integration with a11y
- Testing with test renderer
- Pre-Professional ExperienceVerse (Road on a desert island with buildings being created and billboards as you walk through it that describes my growth before any professional experience)
- Make big screens easier to focus on (more of a problem in mobile)?
- Improve reader mode in Experiences page
