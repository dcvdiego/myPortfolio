  MyPortfolio âœ¨ ðŸš€
</h2>

My name is Diego Chuman. I am an aspiring full stack developer and this is my portfolio repository, why not keep it open-source :D.

Remember to install dependencies after cloning it locally.

### Run Development Environment

```bash
yarn dev # npm run dev
```

### Test Production Environment

The `stage` script will build and start a production server.

```bash
yarn stage # npm run stage
```

Alternatively you can run:

```bash
yarn build # npm run build
yarn start # npm start
```

### CURRENT BUGS

- In ExperienceApp, there is a bug in that the character/camera can go through the tunnel, must be a useEffect limit
- Figure out how to do something when first loop ends so it goes back to being Idle!
