  MyPortfolio âœ¨ ðŸš€ - Beta
</h2>

My name is Diego Chuman. I am an aspiring full stack developer and this is my portfolio repository, why not keep it open-source :D.

Remember to install dependencies after cloning it locally.

### Run Development Environment

```bash
yarn dev # npm run dev
```

### Test Production Environment

The `stage` script will build and start a production server.

```bash
yarn stage # npm run stage
```

Alternatively you can run:

```bash
yarn build # npm run build
yarn start # npm start
```

### CURRENT BUGS

- Figure out how to do something when first loop ends so it goes back to being Idle for avatar animations!
- Can't interact with CustomAvatar for some reason
- In mobile, in the ExperienceApp, scrolling is way too sensitive, not sure why
- The helper overlays don't work in mobile either, it is cut off, styling needs to change or do overlays differently in mobile
- Firefox drei HTML does not work (works in Firefox Nightly with a few bugs such as scrolling)
